# This is my Reading summarize about this topic How computer Work

## first video 
[link](https://youtu.be/mCq8-xTH7jA)
### talks about the computer history and the 4 main process that every computer maks

## 1. Input
### Input is what we do and what the data should access to the computer to do some staff we doing this by using The input Units LIke : mouse and keyboard

## 2. Storage
### Storage is the Database that responsible about store the data to use it on the another computer part Or to fetch when the processor need them 

## 3. Processing 
### do some processing staff like changes and apply some algorithms to redirect the proccesed data to the storage again
## 4. Output 
### this output depends on type of device and when this device connect to the internet this output will be an input data to another device 




## Second video talk about Data & Binary
### second video explain that (the computer work and define everything as a zoro's and one's work with them with the circuts and wires) 
    zero mean Off or False or No
    one mean ON or True or Yes
    These calls Bit 
####  then the video talk about the binary and decimal system 
#### and the video show how the computer see the images, videos, text , numbers, sounds
### This link will explain more about the whole process [READTHEIS](https://youtu.be/USCBCmwMCDA)


## 3rd video Talk about circuits And logic
### the circuits is a millions of tiny wires or true/false signals and the circuits maybe be a like OR operator / AND operator / Not operator

## circuit like Adder circuit like (8 bit adder to add bigger numbers)
### but why the smaller computer is faster *because it has a smaller paths distination circuits


## video 4 Talk about CPU, Memory , Input , Output 
### first of the video make a recab for the computer main types (input, store , process, output)
#### the video contains the as a life cycle of the input to be a output 
the input converts to binary then go to the storage then go to the processor to make some manipulating on them then give the output to the storage to store them until the time that display to Us

[Here](https://youtu.be/DKGZlaPlVLY) the link if you want more explination 



## Video 5 talk about Hardware and software 
## [Link](https://youtu.be/xnyFYiK2rSY)
### Hardware is all of thing can we see and we can touch it (physical thing)  
##### circuits
##### chips
##### speakers
##### wires
##### plugs
### Sotware we can't touch it maybe it be a :
##### Apps
##### Games
##### Websites
##### Data
##### Analysis

### CPU 
#### is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer

### Operating system 
#### is the master program that manages how the software uses the hardware of computer 
#### the software is a series of commands and electrical signals flowing through billions ot tiny circuits
