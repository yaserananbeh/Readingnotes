# Dynamic Web Pages with JS

### How all html and css and javascript work togother 
    every one of them have own extensions and the web page work with them as a layers 
    it apply the html to display the element 
    then apply the css over it to style the element 
    then apply the javascript to make these styled elements interacts with the user and make the page more dynamic

### how to add the script to our website

    It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
    file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
    CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

    The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
    to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
    the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

    If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
    the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
    because the script works with the model of the web
    page that the browser has created. 

### A script
     is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
    Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
    Statements should end with a semicolon.

### WHAT IS A VARIABLE
    the container of any data type that store and hold data with his name 
    we define it like this : Var varName = Value ;
    NOTE : we can change the variable value whenevery we want 

### Some rules to write the variable Name
    - don't start with a number
    - we can use _ or $ just from the symbols
    - we can't use any javascript keyword 
    - CASe sensitive 
    - best practise to use the name that describe his information 
    - best practise to use camel case when we need to splet the words
